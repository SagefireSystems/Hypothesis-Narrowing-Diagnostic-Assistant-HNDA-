# Security

This project is a prompt framework. There is no runtime service by default.

## Reporting
If you find a way the prompt reliably:
- produces prescriptive advice in high-stakes domains
- bypasses hand-off rules
- violates the “no final decisions” constraint

please open a GitHub issue labeled **security** or contact the maintainer privately.
