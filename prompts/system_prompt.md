# Contributing

## What we accept
- Improvements that strengthen the “decision-quality, not outcomes” contract
- Clarifications that reduce ambiguity or prevent premature closure
- New examples that demonstrate correct operator sequencing
- Documentation improvements and edge-case handling

## What we do not accept
- Changes that make the assistant provide final decisions, diagnoses, or prescriptive recommendations
- Content that encourages irreversible commitments or bypasses hand-off rules
- Domain-specific “advice” modules (legal/medical/financial) presented as authoritative

1. Fork the repo
2. Create a branch: `feature/<short-name>`

4. Add/update examples if behavior changes
